## Structure of my overall work

### Trash Magic Manifesto

 - what am I doing and why? State a set of axioms for constructing technology for a free future, build broader definition of free than exists in systems based on "open source" hardware
 - By targeting people and land and materials on the margins of global capital system, an ordering that can spontaneously replicate using those elements can turn the whole system upside-down.  Refugee camps will build better worlds than are currently experienced by the richest urban residents, and that can eat the existing system from below.
 - The basic manifesto is written but is not accessible, it needs to be condensed, re-written, made more clear and less technical, have video content added, be connected to the practical work and be more artistic.  It also needs physical distribution, ideally for free out of trash.  
 - Money needed for further work is rent and food to be able to focus for a solid month of writing after about another year of work on the other parts( a summer camping trip)
 - Next major milestone is getting second edition, then getting it into physical stores
 
### Action Geometry

 - Just as the tools of classical geometry are defined by certain rules and tools, I define a type of geometry based on certain elements which can be found in trash streams.  The goal is a complete system of ordering trash using geometric concepts so that a physical structure exists for technology and culture which can be deployed for free anywhere.  
 - for over 2000 years we were stuck with the basic tools of Euclid, then suddenly we jumped to the digital computer with nothing in between.  One of these is useless religion(when separated from art) and the other is part of yet another religion as described in my manifesto  
 - success will be self replication, which can spread both useful technology, values associated with that, and art and culture.  Impact can bring both joy and basic services for free to those outside the capital system, eating away at that system from below
 - Next milestone is a coherent set of documents taking readers through the system
 - This is a funding source, and should be a combination of seminars, print books, and hustling on the street as a busker of geometry

### Value Geometry

 - use geometry to encode value.  This will be done with hidden objects, guerrilla art, all kinds of fabrication from trash and other materials.  Information must be freed from the technocratic priesthood.  
 - Impact can be secure communication for working freely from government and corporate attacks, easy data transmission without the priesthood, free communication between capitalist "tech" and free technology, recording information which can survive nuclear war, hiding information for others, spreading tales and lore with physical artifacts, making assembly instructions physically encoded into things , free music
 - next milestones are a micro fabricated gold Constitution and NIST publication on same, then sales sheet for rock star thing based on that
 - funding sources are classes on secure and hidden information transmission as a game in office parks, treasure hunts as corporate team building event, consulting on how to implement for large companies and government agencies,research grants for shape assembly code, encoding albums for rock stars in gold and silicon, 
 

### Practice of Trash Magic

 - Using value geometry, action geometry, and the principles of Trash magic, I will build the fundamental tools of technology.  I define the goal of science and technology and art as creating feedback loops which include the human mind, the human body, and the physical and living world. I build these feedback loops, then distribute them into space and culture in such a way that they reproduce.  This will be the substrate on which we can build a new world from the bottom up on the ashes of the dying world of today.  
 - Next major milestone is a deployed motor in the physical world
 - funding sources are classes on building the motors, studying the chaotic pendulum, making and using musical instruments, crowd funded deployments in local places of the physical thing, also sponsorship
