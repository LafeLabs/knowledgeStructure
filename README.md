## Structure of my overall work

### Trash Magic Manifesto

 - what am I doing and why? State a set of axioms for constructing technology for a free future, build broader definition of free than exists in systems based on "open source" hardware
 - By targeting people and land and materials on the margins of global capital system, an ordering that can spontaneously replicate using those elements can turn the whole system upside-down.  Refugee camps will build better worlds than are currently experienced by the richest urban residents, and that can eat the existing system from below.
 - The basic manifesto is written but is not accessible, it needs to be condensed, re-written, made more clear and less technical, have video content added, be connected to the practical work and be more artistic.  It also needs physical distribution, ideally for free out of trash.
